# Testing and coverage

This is the maintained guide to reproducing Toolview checks, not a journal of past runs. Use a repository checkout with its development dependencies; the npm package contains runtime code/documentation, not test fixtures. Visual behavior is specified in the [presentation contracts](../README.md#documentation); integration boundaries are described in [architecture](architecture.md).

## Requirements and commands

- Node.js >=22.19.0, as declared in `package.json`.
- Pinned development host packages installed from the lockfile.
- For terminal tests: a POSIX environment, Python 3 with PTY support, and the real Pi CLI. `PI_TEST_CLI` can select an alternative CLI executable.
- No model credentials are required. The terminal driver uses an offline scripted provider.

From the repository root:

```sh
npm ci --ignore-scripts
npm run check
npm test
npm run test:terminal
npm pack --dry-run
```

`check` is the authoritative strict project TypeScript gate. Unit tests include actual-SDK component/ownership probes as well as deterministic presenter cases. The terminal runner uses `--test-concurrency=1` because its controls drive real CLI processes. Packaging must include every runtime module and maintained document linked from the README, without bundling host libraries or tests.

For a focused edit check, without claiming the unrelated full CLI suite was rerun:

```sh
node --test --test-name-pattern='OpenCode-style edit syntax' --test-concurrency=1 tests/terminal.test.mjs
node --test --test-name-pattern='write cards' --test-concurrency=1 tests/terminal.test.mjs
node --test --test-name-pattern='^footer ' --test-concurrency=1 tests/terminal.test.mjs
node --test --test-name-pattern='^terminal colors:' --test-concurrency=1 tests/terminal.test.mjs
node --test --test-name-pattern='^Output padding settings' --test-concurrency=1 tests/terminal.test.mjs
node --test --test-name-pattern='^main editor user-card|^belowEditor|^editor padding|^aboveEditor widget|^foreign editor extension' --test-concurrency=1 tests/terminal.test.mjs
node --test --test-name-pattern='long-word summaries|comma wrap points|width-21 colored-segment boundary|complete multiline summaries' --test-concurrency=1 tests/terminal.test.mjs
```

Test names, scenario switches and audited package versions live in the test sources; do not maintain a second version inventory or fixed historical test total here.

## Test layers

| Layer | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `tests/unit.test.ts` | Pure formatting/geometry/state regressions, actual SDK integration, compatibility guards and ownership/counter tests |
| `tests/fixtures/cache-probe.ts` | Actual-SDK viewport work and first-installer collection with an active adapter, including an active execution clock, retained write-source rows and the stock input editor |
| `tests/fixtures/cache-partition-probe.ts` | Actual-SDK mixed transcript, independent ordinary/card pressure and detached-edit collection |
| `tests/terminal.test.mjs` | Real bundled CLI execution, physical terminal cells, keyboard/mouse, controls and same-session replay |
| `tests/fixtures/driver.ts` | Offline provider, representative custom tools, explicit metadata-shape scenarios and test-only diagnostics/gates |
| `tests/fixtures/editor-driver.ts` | Real production-extension editor controls and draft-safe shortcut observations; exact public stock identity, not fake-editor execution |
| `tests/fixtures/footer-driver.ts` | Public footer/status controls, real side-usage records and native history/context spies; one loader graph with production Toolview for actual presenter counters |
| `tests/fixtures/terminal-colors-driver.ts` | One loader graph with production Toolview; draft-safe native color/mode snapshots and public-query controls |
| `tests/fixtures/foreign-editor.ts` | Separately loaded extension owning the editor through the real public factory; native/Toolview region and input comparisons, both load orders and late takeover |
| `tests/fixtures/pty_bridge.py` | Real pseudo-terminal transport used by the CLI harness |
| `tests/fixtures/integration-profile.mjs` | Version-audited, isolated installed-extension profile with explicit exclusions |

The unit runner invokes the SDK cache probes in separate Node processes with `--expose-gc`. Forced GC and diagnostic instrumentations are test-only; none run in the extension.

## CLI isolation and evidence

Each CLI run starts with a fresh temporary HOME, agent directory, settings, workspace and session. It loads the offline driver and exercises actual built-in tools, not replacements presented as native execution. Representative metadata fixtures are separate explicit opt-ins. Native, Toolview, off/on, reload and replay controls use the same supplied data and owned workspaces. Child processes use isolated settings and do not inherit model credentials. The installed-profile helper inspects the local package inventory, but tests do not modify user settings, publish packages or change user installations.

Python transports actual PTY output into `@xterm/headless`. Physical-screen assertions inspect terminal cells, including foreground/background/attributes and cursor width, not only calls to `component.render(width)`. The terminal emulator answers native cursor/device queries. Resize waits with a bounded deadline for a fresh, matching PTY ioctl receipt and the fixture's observed Node TTY width/height, not a fixed sleep or quiet output; unchanged dimensions still require a fresh receipt. The observer samples geometry on native resize/session-start events, adds no render requests or draft commands and removes its listener on shutdown. A controlled regression delays ioctl and pauses Pi after ioctl acknowledgement, checking width-only, height-only, identical-size and repeated-target transitions in both modes. Input exercises real keyboard sequences and normalized mouse clicks/selection; no production pointer observer is introduced.

The harness writes fresh evidence under `.test-artifacts/terminal-<timestamp>-<pid>/`. Captures include invocations, dumps, terminal output/screens, tool events, model contexts, sessions and coverage/counter packets. Standalone experiments and review reports also belong under ignored `.test-artifacts/`. Record the tested source baseline, exact command, executed versus skipped coverage, findings and unresolved limits there. Do not append run histories or local agent-session paths to project specifications.

## Strict control comparisons

- Compare actual tool arguments/results, cumulative model contexts and persisted metadata exactly. Presentation checks must not weaken these data checks.
- UI actions must leave saved session bytes unchanged. History replay must execute zero new tools/results/model requests.
- Compare native opt-out/restoration with appropriate native controls, retaining all available output. Normalize only an explicitly variable field, such as native execution duration across separate executions; never erase semantic text to make a comparison pass.
- Native live edit preflight and persisted replay are different in Pi 1.0.0. Compare an edit native override with unpatched replay of the identical session, not a fresh execution whose header may include an asynchronous preview.
- Check complete source/command reconstruction without trimming source characters. Distinguish frame padding from actual source indentation and trailing spaces.
- At narrow widths find complete expected summary row blocks, not only shared title prefixes. When user cards are present, identify Bash frames by actual `$ ` content, not by assuming every `┃` panel is Bash.

CLI edit controls cover dark/light themes, narrow/unified/wide layouts and regular/fullscreen same-session replay. Unit controls additionally cover file-type dispatch beyond the CLI TypeScript/HTML files, alternate metadata shapes, impossible tiny glyphs and native image-protocol fallback. These are distinct layers, not exhaustive parser or graphical-terminal coverage. Compact-preview CLI fixtures use CJK and combining characters for physical Unicode checks; joined-emoji preservation is additionally asserted in unit/source rows. The default headless Unicode 6 provider measures a joined family emoji as four cells while Pi measures two, so exact physical joined-emoji width is not claimed by this harness.

Editor CLI observations use a test-only shortcut so capture does not submit or exchange the draft. The observer loads production Toolview unchanged, controls its actual registered command and verifies native editor identity/state. Remove only the exact zero-column hardware cursor marker when comparing projected strings to physical cells; do not normalize source characters. Native tiny-width wide-glyph recursion, actual OS IME windows and graphical image insertion are outside this gate; unit checks retain native tiny authority, expanded-paste state and atomic programmatic text insertion. Clipboard-image callback/map behavior is not directly exercised; keyboard input and host image handling remain native. Pi's foreign-editor-factory state-transfer/reload limitations are not claimed fixed; the same-default activity-routing self-transfer is explicitly suppressed and regression-tested.

The foreign-editor CLI regression compares a separately loaded factory extension against processes that never load Toolview. It requires identical complete ANSI editor rows, physical input/widget cells, input/expanded-paste/cursor state, hardware cursor geometry and normalized fullscreen mouse events; complete native footer data/ANSI is restored at every foreign-editor lifecycle phase; absolute screen y is checked against each real physical click; upper/lower widgets must remain contiguous with no Toolview separator or metadata/edge rows. Both extension load orders, takeover after warmed stock presentation, a registered factory returning the exact stock class, extension-owned shortcut/method identity, both embedded and separate native active Working, themes/resizes, off/on, empty-draft reload and same-session replay are covered. Tool presentations must remain active; calls/results/model contexts and session bytes stay strict. This is a real factory integration, not full installed `pi-powerline-footer` execution; regular-mode mouse remains terminal-owned.

## Performance counter discipline

Use observable work counters, not timings as the sole proof:

- Compact argument formatting must serialize only bounded string prefixes and visit only the displayed prefix of structured values; path-only edits/writes must not enumerate/read ignored fields. Unicode caps preserve whole graphemes/escapes. These counters do not claim that Pi's native argument processing or root key enumeration becomes bounded.
- An unchanged retained frame must build no custom body and repeat no custom highlighting/wrapping/color work. Updating one tool rebuilds that tool; actual width/theme changes legitimately rebuild affected layouts. Height-only changes/scrolling should reuse retained bodies.
- Proven stock edit custom states must make no discarded native visibility render calls. Unpatched/expanded native controls must remain positive. Custom/mixed/reused-Box self-render visibility must remain native-authoritative, with no phantom neighbor spacing.
- Ordinary and card limits/recency are independent. Card pressure must not evict/rebuild ordinary views. Check per-pool zero/limit reduction, oversized skips, clear/off/shutdown and exact aggregate arithmetic. Lookup misses are not body builds: metadata-only spacing may miss without materializing a diff.
- Retained-byte statistics are accounting estimates; reported process heap is the whole Pi process. Neither establishes Toolview heap ownership, GC pauses or user-session latency.
- Footer counters distinguish session aggregation/record visits from presentation rebuilds. Native `SessionManager.getEntries` and `AgentSession.getContextUsage` spies preserve original methods and expose actual calls. Ordinary width/theme/status changes must not redo history/context work; warm/native-Working frames also rebuild no layout. The fixture loads the unchanged production extension and its diagnostic getter in one graph (separate extension-loader module copies would make false-zero counters); the native control never activates Toolview. Opt-in scripted usage and an explicit real persisted side-usage record are supplied fixtures, not live billing or installed Magic Context validation. Strict traffic/session/replay comparisons remain unchanged.
- Git source counters distinguish discovery and branch refresh from rendering: ordinary warm/animated frames must start zero subprocesses; metadata/semantic changes must refresh without polling. Real temporary repositories cover actual executable results, atomic HEAD changes, available reftable backends and Git environment isolation. Cancelled/old-cwd replies must not publish; disabled/foreign/shutdown runtimes must release watches/jobs. Linux/POSIX CLI evidence is not a Windows filesystem-watcher guarantee.
- Terminal-color counters separate accepted metadata reads, channel sets/releases/packets, default reports, stale replies, projection builds and warnings. The fixture shares the production module graph to avoid false-zero diagnostics. Fifty warm renders must change none of them. Controlled OSC handlers retain application overrides across profile changes, answer with actual model profile/current values and require releases before native auto-selection queries. A public query may also request ANSI palette entries; no palette writes are permitted. Local off can sample released profile RGB without reading metadata or applying defaults. Initially auto and auto reload/switch must keep feature reads/reports/sets/resets zero. Physical foreground/background cells verify the local projection, not only component strings; a native no-feature control and strict tool/model/session replay comparisons remain required. This model does not establish support/no-flicker/identical pixels in every graphical terminal.
- SDK synthetic workloads prove mechanisms, not real tool execution. Keep their results separate from actual CLI traffic/replay evidence.

Alternate-width manual dump probes intentionally replace the latest-width cache. Diagnostic scenarios suppress those probes when measuring warm frames; generic captures keep them for width coverage. Spinner diagnostics also avoid width-zero probes, which intentionally stop animation participation. Native asynchronous startup/grammar invalidation can add cold work; establish a controlled cache-clear epoch before asserting exact warm deltas.

Spinner checks prove one shared 100 ms clock, one request per tick regardless of participant count, unchanged custom builds on ticks, real screen glyph movement, immediate final/expansion/off/restore stop and zero idle ticks/requests. They also retain cancellation, native full-information, replay and active-first-installer GC controls. No total CPU/latency or O(1) host-layout claim follows from these counters.

## Installed-extension profile and limits

The installed-profile test reads the allowlist/version audit in `integration-profile.mjs`. An unavailable or mismatched safe profile is an explicit skip, not a passing integration. Its sanitized environment and temporary configuration preserve real registration while disabling networked/secondary model work and unrelated background services. Fresh HOME is required as well as the isolated agent directory because some packages read `homedir()` directly.

In that profile, local task tools have real execution/renderer coverage. Agent, web, ask and Magic Context integrations have registration-only coverage; registration does not prove their renderer ran. AFT is excluded because startup schedules auto-build/refresh/warmup work; keep-awake is excluded because it starts an OS sleep inhibitor. Deterministic AFT-shaped diff/diagnostic/exit metadata tests do not execute installed AFT or subscribe to its LSP.

No full user-runtime compatibility guarantee is made. Graphical Kitty/iTerm2 image display, all host/parser/terminal versions, identical OpenCode Tree-sitter grammars or literal screenshots, arbitrary competing private-method hooks and whole-process heap/latency distributions are not established by this harness.

## Changing behavior

Start with a failing regression for the contract being changed. Keep native/data controls strict, run the affected gates, and use an independent fresh-file review for substantive behavior/integration changes. Reviewers should read the current source and authoritative SDK/reference sources; summaries and an earlier green run are not a substitute. Record findings and final execution evidence locally, explicitly separating reviewer source inspection from parent-run compiler/tests.

Maintained documentation describes the current architecture, accepted behavior and reproducible verification method. Historical run counts, superseded proposals and agent handoffs are working artifacts, not new project contracts.
