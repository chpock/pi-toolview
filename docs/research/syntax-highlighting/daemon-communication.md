# Communication with a shared syntax-highlighting daemon

**Research date:** 2026-10-07. **Status:** source/documentation-based selection report; not an implementation approval. No performance tests, POC, service installation or service execution were performed for this report.

**Companion report:** [Rust highlighting-library selection](daemon-library-selection.md). The older [shared-service study](shared-service.md) establishes the topology motivation and contains separately conducted experiments; its numbers are not measurements of Subconscious.

## Recommendation

**Use CortexKit Subconscious, through its public TypeScript consumer SDK and Rust module SDK. Make highlighting an internal presentation service, not an LLM tool and not an MCP subprocess per agent.**

This is the strongest fit for this operator's environment because AFT and Magic Context already use the CortexKit ecosystem, and Subconscious supplies the part that a socket library does not: per-user daemon ownership, module launching/supervision, authenticated discovery, concurrent routes, bounded forwarding and reconnect/lifecycle semantics. There is no evidence here that its transport is faster than a direct local socket, and speed is not the basis of this recommendation.

The runner-up is a small dedicated local-socket daemon using `interprocess`/Tokio with a Node `net` client. Prefer that only if depending on Subconscious becomes unacceptable or its actual module/SDK contract cannot satisfy the application. It is simpler as a standalone stack, but substantially more application-owned lifecycle work in this already-CortexKit deployment.

**Subconscious does not require Rust.** It is a process protocol, not a Rust plugin ABI, and its repository also supplies a TypeScript provider and a Swift client. Rust is nevertheless the natural implementation choice here because both the module SDK and the leading native highlighters are Rust libraries. Choosing it should not be justified by a nonexistent Go/C++ prohibition. [C1–C3]

## 1. Separate the three decisions

A transport moves bytes; an RPC protocol matches requests and responses; a process framework discovers, starts and supervises the shared worker. These are not interchangeable alternatives.

| Layer | Examples | What it does not decide |
|---|---|---|
| Transport | Unix-domain socket, Windows named pipe, loopback TCP | Source revisions, RPC errors, module ownership |
| Application protocol | Length-prefixed JSON, typed binary frames, HTTP/JSON, gRPC/Protobuf | Whether ten agents share one worker |
| Process framework | Subconscious; alternatively an application-owned daemon plus OS service manager | Highlighting quality, worker CPU scheduling, source preservation |

Subconscious currently uses **authenticated loopback TCP plus a fixed binary envelope**, not Unix sockets. Its use is therefore not a choice of "Subconscious instead of TCP". The full choice is its transport/protocol/supervisor stack instead of owning that stack ourselves. [C1, C4]

A child binary connected by stdin/stdout remains a **per-parent sidecar** unless an independent shared service exists behind it. Neither writing the child in Rust nor multiplexing requests within one child makes it shared between independent agents. A per-agent bridge to a daemon is possible, but the public Node SDK avoids adding such a bridge solely for highlighting.

## 2. Requirements for this project

1. Independent agents under the same user can reuse one loaded highlighting module across projects.
2. Calls are asynchronous and happen outside Toolview's synchronous rendering path.
3. Source text and syntax ranges are preserved exactly; terminals, line wrapping and diff backgrounds remain client-owned.
4. Replies can arrive out of order, and source/theme revisions prevent stale replies from repainting a card.
5. A disconnected agent, restart or incompatible version fails explicitly without blocking rendering.
6. The system bounds queued work, result/source retention and native CPU work; adding clients must not create one heavy highlighter process per client.
7. Source can contain credentials. It stays within the local user boundary, is not exposed as a public listener or logged as ordinary telemetry.
8. Supported platform deployment does not require changing Pi or AFT internals.

These requirements do not need browser access, remote multi-tenant hosting, a message broker, a general editor protocol or a semantic-language-server fleet.

## 3. Options and trade-offs

| Option | Benefits for this workload | Work/limitations | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Subconscious + public SDKs** | Existing agent-focused process framework; same-user discovery/authentication, module supervision, multiplexed routes, typed lifecycle/errors, wire-level JSON/binary envelope | Young alpha ecosystem; coordinate compatible daemon/SDK versions; module must still own bounded CPU work and source revisions | **Recommended in this environment** |
| **Unix socket / Windows named pipe + framed application RPC** | Small local-only stack; OS endpoint permissions; Rust `interprocess` offers Unix/Windows and Tokio support; Node `net` speaks both endpoint kinds | Own framing/schema, singleton deployment, discovery, auth policy, request correlation, queue policy, restart/reconnect and updates; platform endpoint names differ | Best standalone alternative |
| **Loopback TCP + small framed RPC** | Same network API on all three desktop OSes; easy Node/Rust connectivity; no Unix socket path limitations | Own port discovery, authentication and lifecycle; loopback alone is not authorization | Reasonable if implementing a standalone protocol; Subconscious already supplies this form |
| **HTTP/JSON on loopback** | Very easy inspection and familiar HTTP client/server libraries; unary requests fit snapshots; versioned endpoint/schema can be simple | Still needs a daemon manager and local auth/discovery; JSON size and status conventions are application decisions; growing documents need explicit revision/state APIs | Viable, but duplicates infrastructure already available |
| **gRPC/Protobuf** | Generated typed interfaces, unary and streaming calls, deadlines/cancellation, standardized error model; Rust Tonic/Prost and Node gRPC ecosystem | Extra schema/code-generation/runtime ownership; does not supervise/start a singleton; does not interrupt native parsing merely because an RPC is cancelled | Useful for a wider cross-language service, not justified for this local feature |
| **Connect RPC** | HTTP-based typed Protobuf/JSON APIs, stable TypeScript/Go clients and gRPC interoperability | Official introductory runtime list does not offer a Rust server SDK; verify any chosen Rust implementation separately rather than assuming Go parity; still lacks local process supervision | No advantage over Subconscious for this Rust module |
| **Shared-memory ring buffers / broker / editor protocol** | Potentially useful for specialized zero-copy or distributed/editor workloads | Shared memory adds ownership, synchronization and recovery work; a broker adds another service; LSP/MCP introduce unrelated surfaces | Not justified by current requirements |

No relative latency or memory ranking for these transports is inferred from documentation. Different payload representations, worker queues and startup policies would dominate any unfair comparison. [T1–T5]

## 4. What Subconscious actually supplies

### 4.1 Process shape

```text
agent A / Toolview ── public TypeScript SDK ──┐
agent B / Toolview ── public TypeScript SDK ──┼── ck-subc (per user)
agent C / Toolview ── public TypeScript SDK ──┘       │
                                                    └── one supervised Rust highlighting module
                                                         shared grammars / queries
                                                         bounded worker-local parse state
```

The **router daemon and highlighting module are separate processes**. "One shared daemon" here means one per-user routing daemon and one shared highlighting module, not linking a new syntax engine into the Subconscious daemon itself. Other CortexKit modules remain separate. Multiple routes/binds must not create another copy of the highlighting executable. The module's identity/launch policy is part of its eventual deployment contract. [C1, C2]

Projects/sessions can have separate bind identities while the process reuses grammar assets. A project root in a route identity is not evidence of a per-project process, nor a reason for the highlighter to read files from disk. Source is supplied by the client.

### 4.2 Transport, framing and security

The current sources define:

- Wire protocol **v2**, with a **21-byte header** carrying body length, version/type/flags, channel, route epoch and correlation ID.
- A **64 MiB frame-body ceiling** in the SDK/protocol. This is a transport ceiling, not a recommended source or response limit. JSON escaping and a dense token response also consume the allowance.
- The **wire protocol** supports JSON payloads or opaque binary payloads. A small framed header does **not** make JSON token arrays zero-copy or make every request binary. Actual SDK reply support must be checked separately; see below.
- HMAC-SHA256 authentication with server proof and daemon identity verification, using a daemon connection record containing endpoint(s) and a shared secret.
- On Unix, connection-file ownership and owner-only permissions are checked. On Windows, the implementation relies on the per-user directory ACL rather than claiming equivalent Unix mode checks.
- Route handles bound to the connection and epoch; replies match correlation identifiers, not arrival order.

Use the public SDK's discovery/configuration facilities and the compatible installed fleet contract; do not hardcode a filename from old README examples. The repository explicitly describes `docs/` as working design history, and some README installation/source-only examples lag current package exports. Never copy authentication or envelope implementations into Toolview. [C3–C5]

HMAC authentication protects access within the intended local user trust boundary. It is **not** encrypted remote transport, isolation from every same-user program or authorization to publish the listener externally.

### 4.3 Consumer and module API

The TypeScript SDK exposes `SubcClient`, catalog/route operations, `request`, managed `call`/`callBinary`, cancellation, route closure and reconnect-aware call handling. The Rust `subc-client-rs` SDK supports serving as a module as well as consuming other modules. This is enough to make a presentation-only service without advertising a syntax-highlighting tool to the model. [C2, C3]

**Prefer the explicit `internal_service` role with `agent_facing: false`**, not a fake tool provider. Its public consumer path is `routeOpen({ kind: "internal_service", module_id, service_id }, identity)` followed by `request(handle, ...)`. Current managed `call`/`callBinary` accept only management-surface or tool-provider targets, so they do **not** provide managed internal-service recovery. A small client adapter must reconnect and reopen this explicit route. Representing highlighting as a management-query surface would instead be a deliberate semantic decision, not a shortcut justified by `call()` convenience. No production `syntax.highlight` module/capability is claimed to exist. [C3]

Avoid using the MCP gateway as the normal Toolview path: an extension already running in Node can directly consume the daemon. MCP compatibility is valuable for model-facing tool fleets, but our operation changes presentation and must not add model calls, session records or another per-agent shim process.

**SDK limitation found by source inspection:** the published TypeScript provider builds response/stream flags with `binary=false`; the inspected Rust serve path likewise sends `HandlerOutcome::Response` and `RequestCtx::emit` with `data_flags()` whose binary bit is false. The Node consumer decodes replies from the reply's binary bit, not from the request option. Thus a `Uint8Array`/`Vec<u8>` handler result and the presence of `callBinary` do not prove arbitrary binary reply interoperability. JSON-encoded spans are a supported-shaped candidate; promising compact opaque replies requires a public supported path or an upstream correction verified separately. This is a source finding, not a runtime reproduction or permission to patch Subconscious. [C2, C3, C7]

### 4.4 Limits, cancellation and fairness

Subconscious provides transport admission/priority, flow-control/forwarding bounds, typed route failures and SDK timeout/reconnect machinery. These are valuable, but the module still needs its own application limits. `AbortSignal` emits best-effort cancellation and does **not** immediately reject the request promise; completion or another terminal condition settles it. `timeoutMs` is applied to route-open waiting and then the response wait, not conserved as one end-to-end deadline. [C3]

| Framework capability | Separate highlighter responsibility |
|---|---|
| Correlation and connection/route epochs | Exact document/source and palette revisions |
| Priority/admission and bounded forwarding | Bounded CPU worker pool, per-client fairness, superseded-update coalescing |
| Cancel frames and request timeout | Connecting cancellation to the engine's actual parse/query work |
| Route/module closure and restart handling | Dropping document states and refusing stale result publication |
| Frame length limit | Source/result/cache limits appropriate to available memory |
| Opaque payload routing | Stable syntax-result schema and validation of UTF-8 ranges |

A client timeout, dropped response or cancelled Rust async future does not forcibly stop a synchronous C parser, regex engine or a `spawn_blocking` job. Check and propagate the actual engine's cancellation/budget API. Even gRPC has this application obligation; the transport is not a CPU preemption mechanism. [C2–C4, T4]

Managed reconnect can reopen its supported route types, but our explicit internal-service adapter must reopen its own route and neither path reconstructs application document state automatically. A new daemon/module incarnation requires a full source snapshot or an explicit state-reestablishment exchange. A stale route handle is not the same thing as a stale source revision.

## 5. Application contract recommended for later design

These are constraints for a separately authorized design, not a POC or a new generalized protocol framework.

- **One module identity across workspaces.** Use one compatible user-level highlighting process; keep source/document namespaces separate by client/session. Do not choose a project-bound executable topology by accident.
- **Supply source, not a reread instruction.** The service highlights exactly the saved/submitted text passed to it; filenames are language hints, not permission to load current disk contents.
- **Start with a clear snapshot operation.** A growing-code API may use retained state later, but only if the selected library really supports it and old/new source equality is verified. Transport streaming alone is not incremental highlighting.
- **Return syntax ranges/categories independently of layout.** Prefer UTF-8 byte ranges plus category/style identifiers in a versioned JSON reply for the inspected SDK surface. Node can map those ranges to the original source and Pi's palette. Returning final foreground-only ANSI is possible, but must not reset diff backgrounds or introduce layout. Compact binary replies are not assumed available through today's serve helpers.
- **Keep presentation in Toolview.** Frame dimensions, wrapping, signs, line numbers, diff backgrounds and mouse geometry stay where they are. The daemon is not a replacement TUI renderer.
- **Validate reply identity.** Source revision/hash, grammar/engine revision and applicable palette revision must match before publication. Width-only changes reuse classification without new RPC.
- **Bound work and release state.** Avoid letting one agent monopolize the module. Dispose client/document state on completion, disconnect and reload; do not persist source caches by default.
- **No heavyweight hidden fallback.** A missing daemon must have explicitly agreed pending/unavailable behavior, not silently load Shiki or another full engine in every agent.
- **Use framework-owned lifecycle.** Register/package a module and use normal CortexKit deployment. Do not make ten extensions race to install, upgrade or replace a shared service.

The existing async-precompute integration constraint is explained in [shared-service.md](shared-service.md#integration-constraints-for-toolview). No framework choice makes a synchronous render callback awaitable.

## 6. Maturity and remaining decisions

Subconscious is **young and labelled alpha**, not a general-purpose decade-old RPC standard. The public repository was created in June 2026; observed GitHub counts are only **2 stars / 3 forks** on the research date. These counts do not establish reliability or invalidate its fit. Its meaningful advantage is actual reuse in this operator's agent ecosystem and the explicit module/route/lifecycle contracts, not market popularity. [C1, C6]

Observed published SDKs:

| Surface | Version inspected | Qualification |
|---|---|---|
| `@cortexkit/subc-client` | **0.21.0**, Node >=18, MIT | npm release `gitHead` `97378601cd01e99e888347a6995011d58fd69fc7`; current package exports built `dist` |
| `subc-client-rs` | **0.26.1**, MIT, published 2026-10-03 | Separately versioned Rust crate, not the same version number as the daemon/protocol |
| SDK installed alongside the operator's extensions | **0.13.1** | Older than the published/current snapshot; for example, its Unix connection-file checks omit the newer UID-owner check |
| Fresh repository source | `02e164740a53efd09949d1a3dcfb445767075a49` | Contains protocol-crate 0.29.2 changes newer than the npm release head; do not equate moving master with an installed release |

**Before implementation:** establish the compatible fleet/SDK versions, the module's singleton launch/registration policy, deployment/update ownership, supported platform set, application payload/version/error schema and unavailable-service behavior. These are not reasons to repeat a whole transport benchmark or to add locks/migrations/speculative abstractions now.

**Decision:** Subconscious is the recommended communication/process framework for this environment. Its alpha/version-coordination risk should be explicitly accepted. Keep the transport layer out of syntax-engine selection; neither requires changing the other if the public module contract remains adequate.

## 8. Independent evidence audit and closure

A fresh-context source auditor independently read the completed report and authoritative sources on 2026-10-07. It supported the Subconscious recommendation, process separation, explicit internal-service routing/recovery, cooperative cancellation, timeout qualification and binary-reply limitation. No decision-critical positive claim was contradicted. Runtime interoperability, installed-fleet compatibility and actual singleton deployment were deliberately not tested.

| Written finding | Disposition |
|---|---|
| Literal escaped newlines broke prose and the installed-SDK table row | Corrected to actual line breaks; subsequent Markdown validation passed |
| Binary serve replies must not be inferred from `Vec<u8>`/`callBinary` | Independently confirmed against Rust reply flags, published TS provider and Node decoding; retained explicitly in section 4.3 |
| Alpha/SDK-version and deployment gates remain | Retained as implementation decisions, not falsely closed by source research |

The auditor's overall two-report verdict was **corrections required** for these formatting fixes plus the library report's repository-date wording and concrete GPL packaging distinction. Parent closure is recorded here and in the companion report; this is not a claim that a second independent runtime or post-correction review was performed.
