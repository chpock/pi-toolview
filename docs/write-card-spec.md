# Write card specification

This specification defines the interactive presentation of the exact, case-sensitive tool name `write`. Toolview supports stock Pi and compatible third-party result shapes without identifying the producer or changing execution, arguments, results or session data. [Architecture](architecture.md) owns the host boundary; the [edit contract](edit-card-spec.md) owns the shared diff layout.

## Lifecycle and routing

Before final success, use the ordinary compact presentation: `write <path>` when `path` is a nonempty primitive string, ignoring every other argument without reading it. Otherwise use generic argument formatting. The [compact text budgets](tool-summary-spec.md) apply; long paths wrap rather than acquiring a one-row hard cut. Argument streaming uses the compact left-arrow glyph (`←`), as for edit; actual execution and partial results use the existing shared spinner. Final failure keeps the compact view with every visible segment colored `error`. Never inspect partial/failure diff metadata or paint proposed content as a successful card.

Only a final non-error result can enter the write presenter. Rendering, predecessor spacing, mouse and animation teardown share this condition. Native expansion, images and intentional native hiding remain authoritative. `--toolview-card write` restores native rendering; `--toolview-compact write` takes precedence and keeps every state compact. Unknown self-shell renderers retain actual-width native visibility checks; the stock-edit visibility exception is not extended to write by name or schema.

Card paths accept `path`, `file_path` or `filePath` and display absolute paths relative to the native component `cwd`. The exact compact shortcut uses only `path`, as for edit. Missing usable card paths or unavailable required source delegate to native.

## Saved source and classification

Use only the saved result and call arguments, never filesystem checks, file rereads, backup inspection or input-derived proposed diffs. Stock Pi 1.0.0 write returns a success message without diff/old-content/creation metadata; the input `content` remains available. Compatible AFT results can retain numbered `details.diff`; other producers can supply a supported single-file unified `details.patch` or `details.diff`.

A present `details.patch` takes precedence and must be a supported string patch; malformed/present unsupported metadata delegates to native, not a lower-priority diff or guessed classification. Use the shared parser's number/hunk validation. Inspect source-row kinds across the entire parsed metadata **before context projection**. Headers, hunk markers, omission markers, literal code punctuation and no-newline annotations do not count as source change signs.

| Available data | Title | Body |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Supported complete diff with any removals, including removals only | `← Replaced <path>` | Shared edit-style diff |
| Supported complete diff with additions and unchanged context, no removals | `← Edited <path>` | Shared edit-style diff |
| Supported complete diff with at least one addition and no removals or unchanged context | `← Created <path>` | Resulting diff source with original new-line numbers and syntax, without diff signs/backgrounds |
| No diff, empty supported diff, or context-only metadata without changes | `← Wrote <path>` | Supplied `args.content` with numbers and syntax |
| Explicit `details.truncated === true`, even if some diff rows survived | `← Wrote <path>` | Supplied `args.content` plus `Diff truncated by tool; showing supplied content.` |
| Present malformed/unsupported diff | Native | Native available information |

`Created` is the agreed display classification **content added from zero**, including filling an existing empty file. It is not proof that the file did not previously exist. `Edited` and `Replaced` describe the supplied change pattern, not distinct tool implementations. Do not infer these labels from message text, tool identity, addition/deletion counters or current file existence.

Without a usable diff, the old source and changed positions are unknown. Show the supplied input, not a fabricated comparison. It describes the content the agent submitted; it is not a guarantee of final bytes after producer-side formatting. Where trustworthy `details.noOp === true` accompanies absent/empty/context-only metadata, add `No changes.`. Never infer no-op solely from absent metadata. The truncated warning takes precedence over no-op. Unsupported metadata does not become a no-op merely because it has no recognized source rows.

## Body and completeness

All available changed rows remain visible: no Bash-like preview, compact 256/1024-grapheme cap, body ellipsis or hidden changed-line tail. “Complete” means all available changes, not reconstruction of the whole final file. Producer omissions/truncation cannot be repaired by Toolview; the explicit truncated fallback states that limitation. No diff fallback can identify which submitted lines were already unchanged, so it displays all supplied content.

Plain `Created`/`Wrote` bodies are always one full-width pane. Use right-aligned new-line numbers in `dim`, one gutter space before the number and one space before code; continuation gutters are blank. Do not reserve a sign column or use added/removed tint. Preserve logical blank lines, trailing spaces and available source positions; an empty input has no invented numbered source row. Omission markers already supplied inside an additions-only diff remain visible rather than pretending missing source exists.

Syntax uses Pi's public filename language resolver and native highlighter with active theme roles. Highlight the complete supplied resulting stream before wrapping, carrying multiline token state. Unknown extensions use the ordinary code fallback. Sanitization/tab expansion, grapheme-safe wrapping, tiny-width gutter omission and impossible-wide-grapheme replacement follow the shared file presenter, without changing source/model/session bytes.

`Edited`/`Replaced` reuse edit numbering, signs, Multiply backgrounds, neutral empty counterparts, hunk pairing, interior omission markers and `DIFF_CONTEXT_LINES = 3`. Additions-only/removals-only diffs are unified at every width; mixed changes split only above 120 columns. Context reduction never removes changed rows. The title uses the shared Bash/edit content origin and muted foreground. Shared frame geometry follows Pi's Output padding for exterior margins with one fixed internal cell per side; neutral `toolPendingBg`, stripe and reset restoration are unchanged. Supplied flattened error diagnostics use the same display rules as edit.

## Integration, retention and verification

`src/file-card.ts` is the shared edit/write presenter: validation, source classification, highlighting, context projection, plain/diff rows and validation-only measurement. `src/index.ts` remains the sole host adapter. No tool definition override, execution interception, extra timer, producer patch or presenter registry is introduced.

Successful write frames belong to the `cards` accounting group with Bash and edit diffs. Compact lifecycle/forced-compact views and native fallback belong to `ordinary`. Each component owns one latest layout/group/width with no admission or eviction limits; native removal/clear or owner collection releases its representation. Native updates, expansion, invalidation, width/Output-padding/theme and `cwd` guards apply unchanged. Warm retained frames do no custom source preparation/highlighting/wrapping. Spacing and rejected clicks use retained row counts or validation-only classification, never construct an unretained source body. Plain source builds do not calculate Multiply colors. See the [cache contract](render-cache-spec.md).

Completed panels reveal native details on a selection-safe fullscreen primary click inside the panel. Exterior margins, separators, selection, wheel and secondary events remain non-targets. Ctrl+O remains native; expanded write is native, not another custom full-source view. Off/shutdown/failure/reload release retention and restore owned hooks.

Follow [testing](testing.md): first-red classification/lifecycle regressions; both metadata formats, global/preprojection kinds, clearing, empty/context-only/no-op/truncated/malformed cases; saved-source versus input-source equality; all source rows and syntax without signs/tint; control/Unicode/blank-line safety; widths, both themes, native/image/hidden/override/expansion safeguards; work counters, group attribution, immediate detached-layout release and active first-write-installer GC. Real CLI controls must separately exercise actual stock file writes and explicitly isolated representative metadata fixtures, with physical cells, native input, off/on/reload, same-session replay and exact raw call/result/model/session equality. Metadata-shape coverage is not installed AFT execution.
