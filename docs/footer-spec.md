# Session footer

## Scope and ownership

Toolview installs one noninteractive footer component through public `ctx.ui.setFooter`. It replaces the stock cwd/branch row, usage/model row and separate extension-status row, not the editor or native activity indicator. Cwd/branch and model/provider/thinking are omitted here because the eligible stock input displays them. Footer installation therefore requires Toolview's recognized, still-owned stock editor. A foreign public factory (including one returning the exact stock class), subclass or overridden native presentation keeps the footer native too. Editor padding, autocomplete and temporary native selectors do not disable this input-ownership eligibility. Working/retry/compaction/future activity remains entirely Pi-owned in its native location.

There is one footer slot, not a stack of independent extension footers. The last public `setFooter` call wins. Pi calls our component's `dispose` when replacing it; that releases snapshots and records lost ownership. Off/shutdown restore stock only while Toolview still owns the slot, never erase a later foreign owner, and do not reconstruct an earlier foreign footer. A later loss of editor ownership suppresses our rows immediately; one coalesced microtask restores stock through the public API after normal measurement, only if we still own the footer and the editor remains ineligible. No render-time container mutation, polling or extra editor render is used. Explicit `/toolview on` may reclaim the slot only with an eligible editor; after returning from a foreign editor use that command or reload to reinstall it, not automatic takeover of a possibly foreign footer. For native startup/reload with a temporarily mounted selector, initial installation waits for the stock editor. A weak snapshot of the guarded public footer slot and its single previous component permits that one delayed install only while the same owner remains; a later replacement cancels it. This does not enable general automatic reclaim. Reload creates a fresh enabled runtime. Footer installation does not intercept another extension's `setStatus` or `setFooter` calls. Print/JSON/RPC modes remain inactive.

## Statistics and sources

The ordinary order is one left statistics status, then opaque right-aligned producer statuses:

```text
[····█▅▂▁▁▁] CH98.5% • 105k/272k (38.4%)          mc: 104.5K (51%) · idle
[····█▅▂▁▁▁] CH98.5% • 105k/272k (38.4%) (auto off)
```

The values illustrate independent fields, not one arithmetically consistent traffic trace. The default order is the ten-report inverse cache-read graph, latest CH, then current context. Cumulative token totals, cache totals and cost/subscription remain implemented behind three source-only `FOOTER_FIELDS` flags in `src/footer.ts`, all false: `tokenTotals`, `cacheTotals`, `cost`. Edit source and reload to enable them; no runtime command or persisted setting is added. Hidden cost does not perform authentication lookups merely to prepare an invisible subscription marker.

- Aggregate all raw `ctx.sessionManager.getEntries()` records, not the current branch or compaction projection. Include assistant and usage-bearing tool messages, standalone usage entries, compaction and branch-summary usage, including abandoned history. Do not sum cumulative partial streaming updates or rewrite saved data.
- When enabled, ↑/↓ retain stock cumulative compact formatting, including initial `↑0 ↓0`; R/W appear only for nonzero cumulative cache-read/write tokens. These flags do not control graph/CH visibility. A first cold response with positive input and no cache reads must show a full error-colored bar and `CH0.0%`, even when cumulative R/W are zero.
- CH and its history use only raw primary assistant records. Compute `cacheRead / (input + cacheRead + cacheWrite) * 100` for each report, never a cumulative ratio, request-hit probability or token-weighted average of ten reports. Finite nonnegative input/cache-read/cache-write counts and a finite positive prompt denominator are required. An unavailable/invalid report is unknown, not zero. The latest unknown report shows muted `CH—` even when an older report is known. Side/tool/summary usage contributes to totals but does not advance CH history.
- Trust Pi's normalized usage without provider guesses. Some adapters normalize missing cached-token fields to zero, so a valid positive-input report with zero cache reads shows zero even if the underlying provider omitted that detail. No reliable cache-capability/availability signal is inferred from model/provider names.
- When enabled, cost uses three decimals and native visibility (nonzero total or subscription marker). `(sub)` follows the current provider's subscription-backed OAuth declaration/auth selection, including stock Pi's `kimi-coding` exception. It describes current authentication, not a subscription bill or proof that all historical usage used that authentication. Public registry/provider information supplies it; OAuth alone is insufficient.
- Take used count, maximum and percent together from `ctx.getContextUsage()`, including Pi's applicable routed limit/estimate. Do not reconstruct used tokens from a rounded percentage. Unknown used count is `?/272k`, without a percent. Undefined context usage omits the context block. Real estimates above 100% are not clamped.
- Effective `pi.getSettings().compaction?.enabled` supplies native auto-compaction state (default true). Enabled adds no annotation. Disabled adds `(auto off)`, even if context data is unavailable: dim parentheses, warning text. It warns about configuration, not an already full window; third-party context management and native compaction failures are separate concerns. Append a present context/auto-off block after cache information with dim ` • ` (one space on each side of the bullet); no trailing separator when both are absent.

Cumulative counters keep stock Pi compact formatting: integers below 1k, one decimal from 1k to below 10k, integer k up to 1M, one decimal M up to 10M and integer M thereafter. Context used/maximum have a distinct format: rounded integer k below 1000k; `X.XXM` from 1000k to below 10000k; `XX.XM` to below 100000k; integer M thereafter, retaining additional integer digits for larger values. Keep trailing decimal zeros. Normalize rounding carries before choosing a range: 999.5k becomes 1.00M, 9.996M becomes 10.0M, 99.96M becomes 100M. Examples: 104500 -> 105k, 1500000 -> 1.50M, 12000000 -> 12.0M, 1234000000 -> 1234M. Rounding affects presentation only; small known counts can round to 0k and remain distinct from unknown `?`.

## Cache-history gauge

The gauge is always formatted with `[` and `]` around ten one-column positions. Retain only the latest ten numbers/unknown slots in the existing usage snapshot, oldest left and newest right. Pad missing earlier history with muted `·`; unavailable reports also occupy `·` slots. The latest CH matches the rightmost report, not an older known value. Initial output is `[··········] CH—`.

One actual CH measurement update is one report. Current Pi/Toolview CH reads finalized persisted assistant messages, not streaming deltas: each separate primary model response is a report, including reported usage on errors/aborts. Equal percentages on twenty consecutive requests remain twenty reports; only the last ten are displayed. Do not deduplicate by rounded text, collapse a tool loop into one final user-facing answer or add samples on redraw/semantic refresh. Streaming text updates do not manufacture CH reports. If the measurement source changes in a future host integration, preserve this report definition rather than implicitly collapsing intermediate measurements.

Restore from saved raw records on reload/replay/off-on. Model/branch/compaction/theme changes preserve the same raw-session chronology, including abandoned branches and earlier models. A new session has its own history. No additional persistence, timer, request hook or session mutation is needed.

Use a fixed inverse 0–100% scale and `▁▂▃▄▅▆▇█`; round CH to one decimal first and choose glyph index `round(7 * (1 - rate / 100))`. Thus 100% is the visible minimum `▁`, 0% the maximum `█`; nearby rates can share a height. Do not normalize to the minimum/maximum of the current ten samples. The graph helps spot repeated low cache reuse, not measure unique/cache-resident tokens, absolute uncached token volume, billing or latency. Each small/large request occupies one position. Red indicates low reported cache reads, not request failure.

## Colors

Use the current Pi theme. Unspecified numeric/annotation text is `muted`.

| Piece | Foreground |
| --- | --- |
| Arrow glyphs ↑/↓, R/W letters, $ glyph | `text` |
| Current used-context count, or unknown ? | `text` |
| `/`, `(`, `)`, gauge brackets and cache/context ` • ` | `dim` |
| Cumulative counter numbers, context maximum, sub text, cost digits | `muted` |
| `auto off` | `warning` |
| Unknown/padding `·` and unknown `CH—` | `muted` |
| Context percentage digits and % | Stock raw-percent rules: `error` above 90%, `warning` above 70%, otherwise `muted`; one decimal |
| Each known gauge bar and complete CH token | `success` at displayed rate >=95.0%, `error` below 80.0%, otherwise `warning` |
| Between-extension ` • ` | `dim` |

Round CH to its displayed one decimal before classification: 79.96 shows warning CH80.0%, 94.96 shows success CH95.0%. Context percentage deliberately retains stock raw-value thresholds instead. Producer colors/attributes inside statuses are not replaced with footer colors.

## Status fitting and overflow

Read one snapshot of public `footerData.getExtensionStatuses()` per render. One map entry is one opaque producer status, not necessarily one installed package. Sort stably by key using stock locale comparison; do not reorder for best fit, parse internal bullets or interpret extension-specific metrics. Normalize CR/LF/tab and repeated spaces and trim as the stock footer does. Skip zero-visible-width/empty entries. Close SGR/hyperlink state at each boundary so an unclosed producer style cannot leak into padding, our dim separator or the next status; preserve styling of its own visible glyphs.

When everything fits, statistics are left-aligned and statuses right-aligned on one row, with at least two blank columns between them. Join multiple statuses on that row by ` • `. If the next complete status cannot fit the remaining space, move it intact to a following full-width, right-aligned row; no leading/trailing separator is left at a break. If a status exceeds even an empty full-width row, truncate its tail with visible `…`, ANSI/column/grapheme-aware. Information loss in this case is explicitly accepted. Never internally wrap a status, truncate just to fill leftover space or emit an overwide row.

Our entire left statistics string is one complete status too: graph, CH, context, auto-off and any enabled optional fields must never wrap internally. If wider than a full terminal row, truncate its tail with the same ANSI/column/grapheme-aware dim `…`; information loss is accepted. Cache information comes first, so context loses space before the graph/CH; at still smaller widths the cache block itself can be clipped. Do not reduce the ten retained samples or add graph-height/width heuristics. Producer status packing starts beside this one statistical row, then continues on later rows when complete statuses do not fit. Different statuses may occupy different rows; this is not a globally one-row footer. Width zero returns no rows; tiny widths still cannot exceed the available columns.

Additional rows consume transcript height and are subject to ordinary Pi fullscreen footer clipping (`minSize: 0`). Native separate-status containers also have `minSize: 0`: with four rows, the one-row transcript minimum plus three-row editor minimum can leave both status and footer invisible. Their objects/rendered content remain active, and normal height recovery reveals them again; do not promise physical activity visibility at every height. No allocated-height heuristics, private layout hooks, overlay or alternate notification mechanism is added. This is one base line, not a fixed height under every width/height constraint.

## Freshness and work

`src/footer.ts` aggregates supplied records and prepares themed rows; `src/index.ts` is the only live adapter. It caches a plain numeric/context snapshot by session ID, leaf, current model identity and semantic event generation. Session start/tree/compaction, model selection, completed messages/turns/tools/agent operations refresh that generation; leaf changes catch intervening appends. Get current auto/auth flags normally. Arbitrary unannounced mutation of existing persisted entries is not supported.

Retain one latest width/theme/data/status layout per component, outside both transcript accounting groups. `/toolview cache` estimates these saved footer rows separately and adds them to combined presentation totals without rebuilding or reading session data. `/toolview cache clear` releases the footer layout without resetting numeric usage/history accounting. The numeric snapshot also retains at most ten cache reports, without source message/session/component references. Theme/width/status changes rebuild presentation without rescanning session history or rereading context. Ordinary warm and native Working frames must perform zero new usage aggregations, entry visits, history reads, context calculations or report additions. A new saved report refreshes history even if its CH text equals the previous report. Final saved usage changes rebuild from native records. No timer, new Git source, model request or execution interception exists here. Stock footer already avoids hot history scans; this design preserves that property, not a claim of inherently lower CPU or constant-cost whole Pi frames.

## Verification

See [testing](testing.md). Require first-red SDK controls; actual native cumulative accounting parity behind all three false-by-default source flags (including side/tool/summary/abandoned usage); no hidden auth reads; ten-report ordering/eviction, identical consecutive percentages, zero versus unknown/invalid, error/abort usage, cache-write denominator and side-usage exclusion; saved reload/off-on/replay restoration; context/CH precision and threshold controls; dark/light glyph cells, producer attribute/link isolation; exact-fit/overflow and Unicode/tiny widths; one-row statistics truncation and whole-producer-status transfer/truncation without dangling separators; live settings/status lifecycle; public off/on/later-owner/reload and initial/late foreign-editor disablement, exact-stock foreign factories, overridden stock guards, eligible on recovery, temporary-selector continuity and reload-box initial delay with unchanged-footer-owner protection; active first-footer collection; real regular/fullscreen CLI/native traffic/replay and observable warm/Working counters. Isolated supplied offline usage/status strings do not claim live provider billing or installed Magic Context/Powerline integration.
